# Pretsl Onboarding Application
This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

We **STRONGLY** recommend following these instructions carefully. It's a lot, and will take some time to set up, but your life will be much easier this way in the long run.

## Download (Don't Clone) This Repository

* Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Clone or Download` button and select `Download Zip`.
* Unzip the project and start with the code in that folder.
* Create a new GitHub project and push this code to the new repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `pretsl_onboarding` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL,
    "administrator" BOOL DEFAULT FALSE 
);
```

Please also reference `database.sql` for building the rest of your database. SQL queries provided inside will give the table structure needed to run the application.

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` on your favorite internet browser! Welcome to the Pretsl onboarding application!

## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

Then make sure `Launch Program` is selected from the dropdown, then click the green play arrow.

## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum. 

Keep in mind that once you using the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. [Import the sample routes JSON file](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutes.json) by clicking `Import` in Postman. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
    1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
    2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
    3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!


## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

* `src/` contains the React application
* `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
* `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
* `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

* src/components
  * App/App
    - your app.js file is the root of all of the components in your react app. It contains everything that renders to your internet browser page.
  * Nav/Nav
    - Admin Navigation contains the nav-bar for users with Administrator permissions, here you will find routes to the admin dashboard, onboarding, and support pages.
    - Customer Navigation contains the nav-bar for Non-Administrator priveleges, it contains routes to the customer dashboard, locations, and customer support ticket pages
  * LoginPage/LoginPage
    -this page contains only inputs for logging in a new user
  * RegisterPage/RegisterPage
    -this page contains inputs for creating new accounts, it exists only on the admin side.
  * LogOutButton/LogOutButton
    - this button resides only in the navigation bars
  * ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute
    - this ensures that only authorized users are able to access these pages on the application.
  * AdminDashboard
    - this dashboard holds all the of the information on all of the stores in the current system 
  * AdminIndividualStore
    - This component will present you more detailed information on a single store. It also allows sending mail from an integrated mail service.
